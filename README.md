# Help-Desk-Ticket-Generation
We will automate the creation of help desk tickets using data from an Excel sheet. In this project, once the bot is invoked, it will check whether there are new request files available to process. If available, the bot will read the ticket data from this spreadsheet. The data is then used to create support tickets in the Zoho Desk application.
